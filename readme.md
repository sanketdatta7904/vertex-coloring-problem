Two types of testcases written
Goto dattasukamoto folder and run python Exam-Sanket/main.py and then two choices will be there (1/2):
choice 1:
    It will run testcase only on small graphs written in sample_graph_small.py. select 1/2/3/4  to choose between any one of them.
choice 2:
    It will run test case for individual files. in pace2019_track1_vc_exact_all all the files are stored. To run any single file please enter the number of that file. For file named vc-exact_040.gr enter 40

***Every function that runs in this experiment gets a test involved just after it finished testing. The testing iterates over all the nodes in the graph, and for each node, it checks all its adjacent nodes. If any adjacent node has the same color as the current node, then the function returns False because it means that the vertex coloring solution is invalid. Otherwise, if the function has iterated over all nodes in the graph and has not found any adjacent nodes with the same color, then the function returns True indicating that the vertex coloring solution is valid.
